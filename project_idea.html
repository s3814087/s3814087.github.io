  <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
  <p>A project that i would like to pursue would be to create a web application whose primary purpose is to display financial market data. Given the complexity involved in developing such systems i would like to start small and focus solely on financial market data from the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). The data would be used to generate financial metrics, graphs and charts which traders could use to monitor and analyse the market. They could then use the application to develop trading strategies and adjust them to changes in the market based on the metrics above.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-center">
  <h1>MOTIVATION</h1>
  <p>I find this particular project interesting because Financial Market participants rely on access to financial market data in order to make trading or investment decisions. Because of this, vendors who provide these products are able to command a high premium price for their offerings. Some examples include the Bloomberg terminal or Reuters Eikon terminal which costs over $20,000 per year. Given the decreasing prices that exchanges and clearinghouses charge to access data, you would expect the cost of these products to decrease over time, however they are still rising. As i currently work at a Fintech company i would like to learn how these systems operate and developing my own basic model would start me on this journey. </p>

  <h1>TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES</h1>
  <p>In order to being developing this concept i would need access to an integrated developer environment (IDE) that is suited to coding applications in C#. The best IDE for this task would be Visual Studio (Stackify, 2017). As i would like this to be a cloud based application it would thus need to be hosted online, for this reason i would need an AWS subscription so i can deploy the application on the cloud. As the application will be deployed on the cloud i would also need the repository to be cloud based to ease the task of cloning the application across to AWS. For this reason I will need a github account to store the repository. </p>
