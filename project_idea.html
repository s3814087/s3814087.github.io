  <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
  <p>A project that i would like to pursue would be to create a web application whose primary purpose is to display financial market data. Given the complexity involved in developing such systems i would like to start small and focus solely on financial market data from the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). The data would be used to generate financial metrics, graphs and charts which traders could use to monitor and analyse the market. They could then use the application to develop trading strategies and adjust them to changes in the market based on the metrics above.</p>
</div>
<div class="w3-container w3-center">
  <h1>MOTIVATION</h1>
  <p>I find this particular project interesting because Financial Market participants rely on access to financial market data in order to make trading or investment decisions. Because of this, vendors who provide these products are able to command a high premium price for their offerings. Some examples include the Bloomberg terminal or Reuters Eikon terminal which costs over $20,000 per year. As i currently work at a Fintech company I would like to learn how these systems operate and developing my own basic model would start me on this journey.</p>

  <h1>DESCRIPTION OF FEATURES</h1>
  <p>To keep the project as simple as possible the product needs to have three core features in order to achieve the project overview specifications. The first feature will be the ability to import financial market data from the asx. The will need to be achieved through an Application Programming Interface (API) which will request a time series of historic pricing data for each product on the ASX once the application is launched for the first time. In particular it will need to obtain the high price, open price, close price and low price for each security since inception. Every day after this it will also need to request these four prices at the close of each day which will be added to the historic pricing data along with live pricing data for the current day of trading. The program will also need to request other data such as outstanding shares in order to determine market capitalisation when combined with the above pricing data, corporate action information and general news related to a company. The second feature is the ability to store this data in a robust database that can handle the large volume of data that will be provided from the ASX. The data will be stored in a series of tables, however the two most important tables will be the historic pricing data table and the current days pricing data table. The first table will store the high, open, close and low price for each security on the ASX starting from the first day the company started trading on the ASX. The second table will store the trading prices of a security for the present day in intervals of one second beginning when the market opens. At the end of each day the data in the second table will be cleared. The third feature is the ability to manipulate the above data in order to generate financial metrics on a company. The product will focus on 4 metrics and 2 features. The first metric will be a candlestick graph which will display the historic time series of a company specified by the user. The second metric will be a line graph which displays the current live pricing of a company specified by the user. The third metric will be a market map which allocates each sector of the ASX an area of the graph corresponding to the sectors market capitalization as a percentage of the total market capitalisation of the ASX. The fourth metric will be a list widget which displays the current price of a security in green if its trading above the opening price or red if its trading below the opening price. The user will get to add or remove securities from the list. The first feature will be a news feed which displays links to news articles relating to companies on the ASX. The final feature will be a search bar to search for companies and then display general information on that company.</p>

  <h1>TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES REQUIRED</h1>
  <p>In order to being developing this concept i would need access to an integrated developer environment (IDE) that is suited to coding applications in C#. The best IDE for this task would be Visual Studio (Stackify, 2017). As i would like this to be a cloud based application it would thus need to be hosted online, for this reason i would need an AWS subscription so i can deploy the application on the cloud. As the application will be deployed on the cloud i would also need the repository to be cloud based to ease the task of cloning the application across to AWS. For this reason I will need a github account to store the repository. </p>
