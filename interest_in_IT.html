  <p>Im interested in IT because i want to learn how to read and write source code so i can understand why software behaves in a particular way and also so I can build things myself.</p>
  <p>This interest started when i got a job at a fintech company, where I still currently work as a product specialist.When there is an issue with the software that we cannot explain,we will get a developer to check the logs and source code to determine why something is behaving in a particular way.</p>
  <p>Watching them  solve complex issues over time has given me an appreciation for the skills required to do this and it's now a skill i want to learn myself</p>
