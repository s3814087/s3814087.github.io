  <h1>WHY IT?</h1>
  <p>Im interested in IT because i want to learn how to read and write source code so I can understand why software behaves in a particular way and also so I can build applications myself. </p>
  <p>This interest started when i got a job at a fintech company, where I still currently work as a product specialist. When there is an issue with the software that we cannot explain,we will get a developer to grab logs and then check the source code to determine why something is behaving in a particular way. This is particularly common for issues that we cannot replicate ourselves.</p>
  <p>Watching the developers solve these complex issues over time has given me an appreciation for the skills required to do this and it's now a skill I want to learn myself so I can eventually become a developer and triage these issues.</p>

  <h1>WHY RMIT?</h1>
  <p>I currently work full time and previously had tried studying part time at another uni in the past, but the physical commute to that uni after work and late night commute home after lectures and tutorials was quite exhausting. This uni also did little to help students learn in my opinion.</p>
  <p>After this I started looking for online courses so I could do the lectures and tutorials on my own time at home and eliminate the burden of commuting at night. RMIT was the only uni in australia offering an online IT degree so i signed up for one subject to try it out.</p>
  <p> I quickly found that RMIT was very focused on making learning as easy and convenient as possible for students and the  semester schedule would allow me to study a full time workload at a part time rate with the 4 semester system, so i enrolled in the degree and haven't looked back. </p>

  <h1>LEARNING EXPECTATIONS</h1>
  <p>Over the course of the semester I expect to gain a strong understanding of the different areas of the IT industry and start to form an idea of which direction I would like to focus on as a career path (atm AI and cyber security interest me).</p>
  <p>While i did not expect to learn basic syntax and commands for HTML,CSS and GIT along with how to apply these to build static web pages on Github, this is now an expectation after our first assignment.</p>
  <p>For Github I also expect to learn how to host repositories and clone the source code to an IDE on my local machine. </p>
