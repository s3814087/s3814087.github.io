    <h1>MYERS-BRIGGS TEST</h2>
    <img src="16Personalities.png" alt="16 Personalities Result">
    <p>To me the results of the Myers-Briggs test suggest that my personality type is that of someone who knows what they want, how to achieve it and doesn't let anything get in the way of achieving that outcome. I believe these results will influence my behaviour in the group in a positive light as i will be able to clearly communicate with my team members, discuss ways to allocate the work evenly amongst yourselves and ensure everyone is on track to complete the task in a timely manner. Taking these results into account when forming a team I should probably seek to avoid joining a group with another commander personality type as it may lead to strong clashes in ideas on how to achieve our task which will not be beneficial to the group. </p>

    <h1>VARK QUESTIONNAIRE</h2>
    <img src="VARKQuestionnaire.png" alt="VARK Questionnaire Result">
    <p>To me the Vark Questionnaire test results suggest that it is easiest for me to learn new information when its done in more hands on and practical environment such as learning to code through trial and error as opposed to learning from lecture slides. I believe this will influence my behaviour in the team in a positive light as a group project is the practical application of the lessons we learn in class to achieve a real life outcome which the test suggests is my preferred learning method. When forming a team I should look to form one with others who have a similar learning style as this will allow us to work off each other in a way that will improve our performance since we are utilising the same methods to complete the task. I should also seek to avoid forming a team with those whose preferred learning method is the opposite which may create conflict.</p>

    <h1>BERKELEY EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE TEST</h2>
    <img src="EmotionalIntelligence.png" alt="Emotional Intelligence Result">
    <p>For me these test results suggest that my ability to recognise the emotions of others is poor and needs improving. I do not believe this will influence my behavior on the team as we will be commuting via facebook messenger or slack where viewing others facial expressions will not be required. I do not believe i will need to take this into account when forming a team however i will still look to improve these skills so that if we do communicate directly such as through a video messenger app i will not react in a way that causes a negative emotional reaction from my teammates. </p>
