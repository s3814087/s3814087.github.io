<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>Im interested in IT because i want to learn how to read/write source code so i can explain why software behaves in a particular way 
This interest started when i got a job at a fintech company, where I still currently work as a product specialist.When there is an issue with the software that we cannot explain,we will get a developer to check the logs and source code to determine why its occurring.
Watching them over time has given me an appreciation for the skill required to do this and it's now a skill i want to learn myself
